This directory contains config files for running EISMINT-2 test cases A, B, C, D, F, G and H
with the Glissade local shallow-ice solver.
These are the seven cases discussed in the paper by Payne et al. (2000, JGR).
Tests I, J, K and L are omitted.

The Glissade local SIA solver is similar to Glide, except that the continuity equation
is solved using an explicit upwind-weighted advection scheme (usually incremental remapping)
instead of an implicit diffusion scheme.
See module glissade_velo_sia.F90 for the solver algorithm.

The different settings, compared to the Glide tests, are as follows:
* dycore = 2 (Glissade)
* evolution = 3 (IR transport)
* vertical_evolution = 0 (not constrained by upper kinematic BC)
* which_ho_approx = -1 (Glissade local SIA solver)
* which_ho_sparse = 3
* ice_limit = 1 (minimum thickess for active ice = 1 m)

Note: The Glissade local SIA scheme does not need a sparse solver,
but the default value (which_ho_sparse = 0) triggers an error in parallel runs.

Tests are typically run as follows:

   > ./cism_driver e2.a.config

where cism_driver is a symbolic link to the executable:

      cism_driver@ -> ../../../builds/mac-gnu/cism_driver/cism_driver

The Glissade SIA solver is slower than Glide.
Unlike Glide, however, the Glissade solver can be run in parallel, e.g.

   > mpirun -n 4 ./cism_driver e2.a.config

One config file, e2.a.config.diva, is included with higher-order settings
appropriate for the Glissade DIVA solver.
Other config files could be modified in a similar way.
