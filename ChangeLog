Basal hydrology scheme, new basal friction and inversion options ESCOMP/CISM PR#61

This PR includes three main lines of effort:
(1) updates to the slab test
(2) a steady-state flux routing basal hydrology scheme
(3) various basal friction and inversion options to support Antarctic ice sheet experiments

The slab test is as described in Section 3.4 of Robinson et al. (TC, 2022). It was used in that paper
to test the stability of various solvers (SIA, SSA, DIVA, L1L2) in the simple case of an infinite slab
of ice flowing down an inclined plane. Various test parameters can be specified when launching
the run script. See the README file for details.

The hydrology scheme is based on the idea that all water input at the bed is conservatively routed down
the hydraulic gradient until it reaches the ice margin. Steady state means that for each grid cell, the
water output is equal to the input. Water can be routed to one downstream neighbor (D8), two neighbors
(Dinf), or all downstream neighbors (FD8). The scheme uses the efficient algorithm of Planchon & Darboux
(2001) to fill depressions. It is fully parallel, unlike the similar scheme in old Glimmer. The scheme
has been tested for the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets; more testing and tuning will follow.

The basal friction and inversion changes include the following:

 - support for the Zoet-Iverson basal friction law
 - an option to invert for Cc (aka Coulomb_c) in basal friction laws that have a Cc term, including ZI and pseudo-plastic. Previous inversions were for Cp (aka powerlaw_c) only.
 - an option to apply an observation-based dH/dt field to floating ice during spin-up. This allows the ice to reach a spun-up steady-state and then to thin at observed rates during the subsequent forward run. This option was used for ISMIP6 Antarctica 2300 experiments. A similar option was used in the paper by van den Akker et al. (TC, 2024).
 - an option to include a relaxation term when inverting for Cp and Cc, in addition to the terms proportional to (H - Hobs) and dH/dt. This term reduces clumping of Cc and Cp around their max and min values.
 - new options for computing effective pressure, including an option to be used with the new hydrology scheme
 - an option to invert locally for deltaT_ocn
 - an option to invert for basin-scale flow factors
 - an optional velocity target for Cp and Cc inversion
 - an option to apply a time scale to mask-based calving
Results from this branch were compared to main for several standard test cases.
Using LIVVkit (with several dome, ISMIP-HOM, shelf, and stream tests), all tests pass. The stream test requires a config file change.
MISMIP+ results are also BFB, with several config file changes.
DIVA dome tests are not quite BFB, but agree within machine roundoff. I think this is acceptable, given the large number of changes on this branch.


Changes in CISM tag cism_main_2.01.013
======================================

Updates to support building and running on Derecho. Removing redundant use statements that slowed the Intel build. Changes to Python tests to make them python3 compatible and bit for bit. Changes to update old SLAP code and make it slightly nicer for modern compilers.

Changes in CISM tag cism_main_2.01.003
======================================
ESCOMP/cism/main 792e43f and 410b384

This tag simply renames parallel_mod to cism_parallel to address a naming conflict in CESM.

Changes in CISM tag cism_main_2.01.002
======================================
ESCOMP/cism/main from approx e1713c31 (6/9/19) to 0be5b9c (4/21/21)

This tag begins use of the "Main" branch as the default in ESCOMP/CISM. It also brings in all of the code changes from the cism_development branch. These changes include:
* Support for running ISMIP6 standalone ice sheet experiments, including options to read SMB and ocean forcing and to invert for basal sliding and melting parameters.
* New schemes for sub-ice-shelf melting and CESM ocean coupling.
* Optimization of some parallel functions to speed up computation.
* Support for multiple ice sheet instances when CISM is coupled to CESM.
* Some code clean-up and a few bug fixes.

Changes in CISM Version 2.0
===========================

CISM version 2.0, which originated from Glimmer-CISM and Glimmer, has a number of major changes and additions relative to these previous codes, including:

* addition of robust, parallel, 2D and 3D, higher-order accurate approximations to the Stokes momentum balance (Blatter-Pattyn, L1L2, and SSA, all available within the "Glissade" dynamical core)
* adition of 3D, parallel mass and temperature transport
* addition of software interfaces to modern C++ based solver libraries (e.g., Trilinos)
* replacement of the Autotools build system with Cmake build system
* addition of new test cases for higher-order models, including several with analytical solutions
* re-ordering of the time step to be fully consistent with explicit forward Euler scheme
* addition of a new high level "cism_driver", which replaces and reproduces functionality of several old drivers and allows for more flexible integration of additional and/or external dycores
* re-arrangement of the directory structure
* modifications to the Glint coupling software to support coupling with CESM and other climate models that compute surface mass balance external to the ice sheet model
* new and updated documentation
