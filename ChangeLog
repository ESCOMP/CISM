CISM Changelog

Changes in CISM tag cism_main_2.01.002
======================================
ESCOMP/cism/main 792e43f and 410b384

This tag simply renames parallel_mod to cism_parallel to address a naming conflict in CESM.

Changes in CISM tag cism_main_2.01.002
======================================
ESCOMP/cism/main from approx e1713c31 (6/9/19) to 0be5b9c (4/21/21)

This tag begins use of the "Main" branch as the default in ESCOMP/CISM. It also brings in all of the code changes from the cism_development branch. These changes include:
* Support for running ISMIP6 standalone ice sheet experiments, including options to read SMB and ocean forcing and to invert for basal sliding and melting parameters.
* New schemes for sub-ice-shelf melting and CESM ocean coupling.
* Optimization of some parallel functions to speed up computation.
* Support for multiple ice sheet instances when CISM is coupled to CESM.
* Some code clean-up and a few bug fixes.

Changes in CISM Version 2.0
===========================

CISM version 2.0, which originated from Glimmer-CISM and Glimmer, has a number of major changes and additions relative to these previous codes, including:

* addition of robust, parallel, 2D and 3D, higher-order accurate approximations to the Stokes momentum balance (Blatter-Pattyn, L1L2, and SSA, all available within the "Glissade" dynamical core)
* adition of 3D, parallel mass and temperature transport
* addition of software interfaces to modern C++ based solver libraries (e.g., Trilinos)
* replacement of the Autotools build system with Cmake build system
* addition of new test cases for higher-order models, including several with analytical solutions
* re-ordering of the time step to be fully consistent with explicit forward Euler scheme
* addition of a new high level "cism_driver", which replaces and reproduces functionality of several old drivers and allows for more flexible integration of additional and/or external dycores
* re-arrangement of the directory structure
* modifications to the Glint coupling software to support coupling with CESM and other climate models that compute surface mass balance external to the ice sheet model
* new and updated documentation
